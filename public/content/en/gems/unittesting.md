# Unittesting

D has unit-testing built-in right from the start. Anywhere
in a D module `unittest` blocks can be used to test
functionality of the source code.

    // Block for my function
    unittest
    {
        assert(myAbs(-1) == 1);
        assert(myAbs(1)  == 1);
    }

`unittest` blocks can contain arbitrary code which is just
compiled in and run when the command line flag `-unittest`
is passed to the DMD compiler. DUB also features compiling
and running unittest through the `dub test` command.

Typically `unittest`s contain `assert` expressions that test
the functionality of a given function. `unittest` blocks
are typically located near the definition of a function
which might be at the top level of the source, or even
within classes or structs.

As the compiler is able to infer attributes for templated code
automatically, it is a common pattern to add annotate unitests
to ensure such attributes for the tested code:

    unittest @safe @nogc nothrow pure
    {
        assert(myAbs() == 1);
    }

## {SourceCode}

```d
import std.stdio;

struct Vector3 {
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;

    double dot(Vector3 rhs) const {
        return x*rhs.x + y*rhs.y + z*rhs.z;
    }

    // That's okay!
    unittest {
        assert(Vector3(1,0,0).dot(
          Vector3(0,1,0) == 0);
    }

    string toString() const {
        import std.string: format;
        return format("x:%.1f y:%.1f z:%.1f",
          x, y, z);
    }

    // .. and that too!
    unittest {
        assert(Vector3(1,0,0).toString() ==
          "x:1.0 y:0.0 z:0.0");
    }
}

void main()
{
    Vector3 vec = Vector3(0,1,0);
    writeln(`This vector has been tested: `,
      vec);
}

// Or just somewhere else.
// Nothing is compiled in and just
// ignored in normal mode. Run dub test
// locally or compile with dmd -unittest
// to actually test your modules.
unittest {
    Vector3 vec;
    // .init a special built-in property that
    // returns the initial value of type.
    assert(vec.x == double.init);
}
```
