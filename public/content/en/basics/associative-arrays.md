# Associative Arrays

D has built-in *associative arrays* also known as hash maps.
An associative array with a key type of `int` and a value type
of `string` is declared as follows:

    int[string] arr;

The value can be accessed by its key and thus be set:

    arr["key1"] = 10;

To test whether a key is located in the associative array, the
`in` expression can be used:

    if ("key1" in arr)
        writeln("Yes");

The `in` expression returns a pointer to the value
which is not `null` when found. Thus existence check
and writes can be conveniently combined:

    if (auto val = "key1" in arr)
        *val = 20;

Access to a key which doesn't exist yields an `RangeError`
that immediately aborts the application. For a safe access
with a default value, `get(key, defaultValue)` can be used.

AA's have the `.length` property like arrays and provide
a `.remove(val)` member to remove entries by their key.
It is left as an exercise to the reader to explore
the special `.byKeys` and `.byValues` ranges.

an associative array that maps words to their
respective word counts.

    // the string.
    alias pred = c => c == ' ' || c == '.'
      || c == ',' || c == '\n';

    // The parameter we pass behind ! is an
    // expression that marks the condition when
    // to split text
    foreach(word; splitter!pred(text.toLower()))
    {
        // Increment word count if word
        // has been found.
        // Integers are by default 0.

    string text = q{This tour will give you an

to efficient, *native* machine code.};

    auto wc = wordCount(text);
    writeln("Word counts: ", wc);

    // byKey, byValue and byKeyValue allow iteration
    foreach (word; wc.byValue)
        writeln(word);
